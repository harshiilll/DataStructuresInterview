## What is a Hash Map? ##


Hashmap is used for storing data in key value pairs. We can use a hashmap for storing objects in a application and use it further in the same application for storing, updating, deleting values. Hashmap key and values are stored in a bucket to a specific entry, this entry location is determined using Hashcode function.
