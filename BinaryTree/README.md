## What is a Binary Tree? ##

A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, and a data element. The topmost node in the tree is called the root. Every node (excluding a root) in a tree is connected by a directed edge from exactly one other node.

### What is a root? #
*A binary tree have only one root.*
The root node may be considered the top if the visual representation is top-down or the bottom if it is bottom-up. The analogy is that the tree starts at the roots and then goes up to its crown, so the first node is considered the root.



### What is a node? #
*A binary tree can contains multiple nodes.*
A node is a structure which may contain a value or condition. Each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes, which are below it in the tree.


### What is a leaf? #
Leaf is a node that does not contain children. Its the end of the binary tree.
